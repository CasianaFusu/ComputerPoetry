# ComputerPoetry
"Can a computer write poetry?" 

This project proposes a Romanian based application developed by using both probabilistic and recurrent neural network models. The goal is to generate a text with metrical constraints (rhyme, number of syllables), that can be read as poetry. The idea of the system came from [GhostWriter](http://www.emnlp2015.org/proceedings/EMNLP/pdf/EMNLP221.pdf). Many of the functions used were adapted from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/poetry-generator-rnn-markov/notebook) and [here](https://github.com/mary-octavia/Syllabification.git). I also made available the data set that we used for training, the current rhyme dictionary and a pre-trained model.


## Getting started

The environment used to develop and test the app is [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) from Google. Colab provides GPU and itâ€™s totally free. If you need more information on how to use Google Colab notebooks, you cand find good information [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c).

1. Click on New Notebook. 
2. Go to Edit -> Notebook Settings and choose Python3 and Hardware Accelerator, GPU.

## Prerequisites

Using the new created Notebook, you need to install [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify):

```python
! pip install markovify
```
Upload the data set and the files for rhymes in the current file system. We recommand to upload them in /content, in order to not be forced to change any path in the code. 

Next step is to import and run all the functions using the notebook. Keep in mind that it's very important to run all the functions before trying to use them.

## Contribution

This is still under development and because we believe in the power of ideas, the project is open to contributions.
